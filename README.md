## Setup

You should use node 10.13.0 and yarn 1.12.1 o npm 6.4.1, if you use nvm just run:

`nvm use`

Then:

`yarn` or `npm i`

You should also run [api](https://github.com/marconucara/kiwi-homework-api).


## Run the project

If you have api running, in the project directory, you can run:

`REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8888/ npm run start`

If you DO NOT have api running, in the project directory, you can run:

`npm start`

and the hints will be mocked.


## Test

`npm test`
