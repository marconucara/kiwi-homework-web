This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

You should use node 10.13.0 and yarn 1.12.1 o npm 6.4.1, if you use nvm just run:

`nvm use`

Then of course:

`yarn`

or:

`npm i`

You should also run [api](https://github.com/marconucara/kiwi-homework-api).

## Run the project

If you have api running, in the project directory, you can run:

`REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8888/ npm run start`

If you DO NOT have api running, in the project directory, you can run:

`npm run start`

and the hints will be mocked.

## Test

`npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
